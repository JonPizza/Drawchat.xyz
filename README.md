wow i made another website u won't be able to log into it because it is only for people at my school so u need a school email, it's not because i don't trust u but it's because i don't trust the people at my school to be anonymous and be RESPONSIBLE.

ok but i think it is at least a little bit cool so if u wanna host it for your own google org or just for anyone to join make some oauth thing at google  (it's annoying) and then `p manage.py createsuperuser` and login at `/admin` and add the token and then you just need to `p manage.py runserver` and WHOOPs there is an error! just start bruteforcing the numbers 1-10 for the `SITE_ID` variable and maybe it will work. if that doesn't work then idk just figure it out lol.
